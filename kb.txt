comprehensive Customer Support and Service Policy for electronics
Section: Return Policy for Electronics
When it comes to returning electronics, we understand the importance of flexibility and customer confidence. We offer a 7-day return window from the date of delivery for all electronic items, subject to certain conditions. Customers may initiate a return if the product is received in a defective condition, is damaged during transit, or does not match the product description listed on our website at the time of purchase. For example, if you ordered a smartphone and received a different model or color, or if the item arrives non-functional, you are fully eligible for a return and replacement or refund.

All returns must be made with the complete product packaging, including the original box, user manuals, warranty cards, and accessories such as chargers, cables, or remote controls. If any of these components are missing or tampered with, the return request may be declined. In the case of items like personal grooming devices, earphones, or wearable tech, returns are not accepted unless the product is dead on arrival or develops a fault within 24 hours of usage. This is in adherence to hygiene and safety standards.

We also request that customers do not attempt to repair or open the device before initiating the return. Self-repair or visiting unauthorized repair shops voids both the warranty and the return eligibility. Once your return is picked up, it undergoes a quality inspection. If approved, your refund or replacement will be processed within the timeline mentioned in our refund policy. Our goal is to make your return experience seamless and fair while ensuring that the policy is not misused.

Refund Policy for Electronics
We are committed to ensuring a smooth and trustworthy shopping experience, and part of that is making our refund policy transparent and customer-friendly. Once a return has been successfully initiated and the product has been picked up by our logistics partner, it undergoes a quality inspection at our facility. This inspection ensures that the item returned matches the original purchase and has not been tampered with, damaged by the user, or exchanged with a different product. Only after this verification process is complete do we proceed with issuing a refund.

The refund is generally processed within 5 to 7 business days from the date of approval. If the product was purchased using online payment methods such as debit/credit cards, UPI, or wallets, the refund will be automatically credited to the original payment source. In the case of Cash on Delivery (COD) orders, customers will be prompted to provide their bank account details via a secure form, and the refund will be processed through NEFT or IMPS. It is important to ensure that the bank details entered are accurate and belong to the original customer who placed the order, as mismatched information can delay the process.

If you haven't received your refund within the mentioned timeframe, we recommend checking your bank statement or digital wallet transaction history before contacting support. In some cases, the refund may be credited under a different reference name. Additionally, certain banks may take a few extra days to reflect the transaction. We urge customers to be patient, as once the refund is initiated from our end, it is generally out of our control. If a dispute arises or there is a need for escalation, our customer service team is always available to assist and resolve the issue promptly.

Cancellation Policy
We understand that plans can change, and you may need to cancel an order shortly after placing it. Our cancellation policy is designed to give you maximum flexibility while ensuring smooth operational flow at our end. Customers can cancel an electronics order anytime before it is packed and shipped. As long as the item has not yet entered the shipping process, you can simply go to your account’s “My Orders” section, select the item you wish to cancel, and click on the “Cancel Order” button. A confirmation message will appear, and the cancellation will be processed instantly.

Once your cancellation is confirmed, any amount paid will be refunded in full using the original mode of payment. For prepaid orders, this process typically takes 2 to 4 business days. If you’ve opted for Cash on Delivery, no action is required after cancellation. However, if a COD order is refused at the time of delivery without prior cancellation, the account may be marked for non-serious activity, which could limit COD access in the future. We request all customers to use the cancellation feature responsibly and in good faith.

Please note that orders cannot be cancelled once they are shipped. In such cases, you will need to wait for the order to be delivered and then place a return request according to our return policy. Also, some items marked as “Non-Cancellable” on the product page—such as engraved laptops, software licenses, customized bundles, or items sold during flash sales—cannot be cancelled after the order is placed due to the personalized or high-demand nature of the product. If you have made an error or wish to make changes to your shipping address or payment method, we recommend contacting customer support within 1 hour of placing the order for the best chance at modifying the order before dispatch.

Shipping and Delivery for Electronics
We take shipping and delivery very seriously, especially when it comes to delicate and high-value electronics. Once an order is placed, it is processed and packed at our nearest fulfillment center that has the item in stock. We aim to dispatch all electronics within 24 hours of order confirmation. For metro cities, deliveries typically take 2 to 3 business days, while non-metro and rural areas may take up to 5 to 7 business days depending on logistics partner reach, weather conditions, and regional accessibility.

For large electronics such as LED TVs above 43 inches, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines, we use specialized logistic providers who handle fragile and oversized shipments. These items are packed with reinforced protective layers and dispatched with instructions for careful handling. Customers will receive regular SMS and email updates regarding the status of their shipment. As soon as the item is dispatched, a tracking link is generated which can be accessed from the “My Orders” section of your account. If you have not received your tracking link within 48 hours of placing your order, we recommend reaching out to our support team for assistance.

Our logistics partners make up to two delivery attempts. If the recipient is not available at the delivery address, a missed delivery SMS will be sent with rescheduling options. For high-value orders above ₹25,000, we may require an OTP or signature on delivery to ensure secure handover. In the rare event of a delivery marked as “delivered” but the customer hasn’t actually received the package, we urge you to report the issue within 48 hours. This allows us to initiate a logistics audit and resolve the case efficiently. For prepaid orders, if the delivery is delayed beyond 10 business days, customers are eligible to receive a full refund upon cancellation, no questions asked.

We do not ship to P.O. boxes, APO addresses, or internationally at this time. All deliveries are made during standard business hours between 9:00 AM and 8:00 PM. Customers are advised to ensure someone is present at the delivery address to receive the package. In case of visible tampering or damage to the box at the time of delivery, we strongly recommend refusing the package and reporting the issue immediately so that a replacement can be dispatched without delay.

Payment Methods and EMI Options
We offer a wide variety of payment options to make your electronics shopping experience smooth, secure, and flexible. Whether you prefer digital wallets, traditional banking, or Buy Now Pay Later schemes, we’ve got you covered. At checkout, you can choose from credit cards, debit cards, net banking, UPI, and leading mobile wallets such as PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and Amazon Pay. All transactions are encrypted with 256-bit SSL security to ensure your financial information is fully protected.

For customers looking to manage their expenses over time, we provide flexible EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) options. EMI can be availed through select credit cards issued by major banks such as HDFC, ICICI, SBI, Axis Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Once you choose EMI at checkout, the total cost of the order is automatically divided into equal monthly payments, and interest charges, if any, are clearly shown before payment confirmation. We also offer no-cost EMI on selected products, where the interest component is waived off, and you only pay the actual product price split across 3, 6, or 9 months.

In addition, we’ve partnered with third-party finance providers like ZestMoney, Simpl, and LazyPay to offer instant credit with minimal documentation. These options are particularly helpful for customers who do not own a credit card but still wish to split their payments. Eligibility for such services is determined in real-time based on your mobile number, past repayment history, and basic KYC.

For those who still prefer the traditional route, we continue to offer Cash on Delivery (COD) for orders up to ₹5,000. Please note that some pin codes or high-value electronics may not be eligible for COD due to risk constraints. In such cases, the payment page will automatically hide the COD option. COD orders may also be subject to confirmation calls or SMS verification to prevent misuse.

If your payment fails at checkout, it may be due to server timeouts, insufficient balance, or bank-side verification. In such cases, you will not be charged, and the amount, if deducted, is automatically refunded by your bank within 5–7 working days. For further assistance, our billing support team can be reached at billing@electronicsmart.com, and they’ll be happy to verify the transaction and help you complete your order.

Warranty and Repairs for Electronics
We understand that purchasing electronics is a significant investment, and that’s why we ensure every product is backed by a reliable warranty and a transparent repair policy. Most of the electronic items we sell — including smartphones, laptops, tablets, televisions, kitchen appliances, and personal gadgets — come with a standard manufacturer warranty ranging from 6 months to 2 years, depending on the brand and product type. The exact duration and coverage details are clearly mentioned on each product page under the “Warranty” tab and are also printed on the invoice generated at the time of purchase.

A manufacturer warranty typically covers issues related to hardware malfunction, manufacturing defects, software errors that occur without user interference, and performance degradation under normal usage. However, it’s important to note that warranties do not cover physical damage, water exposure, wear and tear, accessories such as batteries or charging cables (unless explicitly mentioned), or issues caused by unauthorized servicing. To claim your warranty, you must retain both the original invoice and the warranty card, if provided. These are mandatory for walk-in visits at authorized service centers.

In the event of a product malfunction, we recommend customers first contact the respective brand’s customer care helpline. Most brands offer doorstep diagnostics or pickup-and-drop services for in-warranty claims. You will need to provide your registered mobile number, product serial number, and invoice copy for verification. In some cases, a technician visit may be scheduled for on-site inspection, especially for large appliances like air conditioners and washing machines.

If your product is still under warranty and the issue is eligible, repairs are carried out free of cost. In cases where the item is beyond economical repair or has a known defect batch, brands may offer a replacement or credit note. However, any tampering, modification, or attempt to repair the product by third-party technicians will void the warranty immediately. We also advise against using accessories not recommended by the brand, as such usage often leads to damage that is not covered under warranty.

Additionally, we offer extended warranty and accidental damage protection plans at the time of checkout. These are facilitated by third-party insurers or directly by the brand and provide coverage beyond the standard warranty period. Claims under extended warranties follow a slightly different process and require activation within 7 days of purchase. Full policy details, terms, and claim instructions are provided via email upon purchase of the plan.

For out-of-warranty products, our support team can help you locate the nearest authorized service center or schedule a paid repair service. While we do not directly perform repairs, we can assist you in estimating service charges and spare part costs based on the issue reported. We are here to ensure that your electronics run smoothly long after the purchase, with the least possible hassle.

Installation and Demo for Large Electronics
Purchasing large electronics such as televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, and air conditioners often involves more than just unboxing the product — proper installation is key to ensuring that the appliance functions optimally and safely. That’s why we work closely with brand-authorized technicians to provide free or subsidized installation and demo services for all eligible products. These services are either bundled with your purchase or available at a nominal cost, depending on the brand and model.

Once your product is delivered, the installation request is automatically triggered in our system and forwarded to the brand's service partner. You will receive an SMS and email with the technician’s details and estimated appointment time within 24 to 48 hours of delivery. In some regions, especially Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities, installation may even be completed on the same day as delivery. The technician will arrive with all necessary tools and perform the setup as per brand guidelines, including wall-mounting (if applicable), wiring, first-time configuration, and functional testing.

It is extremely important that the product packaging remains unopened until the technician arrives. Opening the box yourself or attempting DIY installation may lead to warranty cancellation or installation refusal. For wall-mounted TVs or split air conditioners, drilling, mounting, and bracket costs may be charged separately if not covered by the brand. The technician will inform you of any applicable charges in advance, and a payment receipt will be issued on-site if needed.

The demo process includes a walkthrough of the basic features, settings, and maintenance tips. For instance, in the case of washing machines, the technician will demonstrate different wash programs, water inlet configurations, and filter cleaning. Similarly, for smart TVs, you’ll be guided through network setup, app installation, and remote pairing. This ensures that even first-time users feel confident operating the device without the risk of misconfiguration or damage.

In rural areas or pin codes not serviced directly by the brand, we make every effort to arrange for a certified third-party technician. However, in some rare cases, installation may be delayed by a few days due to logistical constraints. We advise customers to avoid using the appliance until installation is complete, especially in the case of high-voltage or plumbed-in appliances like dishwashers and geysers.

If you have not received an installation update within 48 hours of product delivery, you can contact our support team or the brand directly using the helpline number provided in your order confirmation email. Our support team will escalate the request and ensure timely resolution. Remember, a proper installation not only ensures safe usage but also plays a crucial role in validating your warranty coverage.

Troubleshooting Common Issues in Electronics
Even the best electronic devices can occasionally run into problems, but most issues are minor and can be resolved with a few simple steps at home. Whether it’s your smartphone not powering on, your smart TV refusing to connect to Wi-Fi, or your washing machine displaying an unfamiliar error code, we’ve got you covered with practical solutions before you even need to call for help.

If your smartphone won’t turn on, begin by charging it using the original adapter and cable for at least 30 minutes. Sometimes, the battery may have completely drained and requires a jump-start. If there’s no response even after that, try holding the power button and volume-down key together for 10 seconds to trigger a forced restart — a trick that works for many Android and iOS devices. If still unresponsive, the issue could be hardware-related and you should contact the service center.

For smart TVs that won't connect to Wi-Fi, first confirm whether other devices are accessing the same network without problems. If the issue is isolated to the TV, go to the network settings and try forgetting and reconnecting to the Wi-Fi. In case of persistent issues, restart both the TV and router. Also ensure your TV software is up to date — many connectivity bugs are fixed via firmware updates. If nothing works, performing a factory reset is often a reliable last resort before service assistance is needed.

When it comes to laptop overheating, the issue is commonly due to blocked air vents or outdated BIOS drivers. Avoid placing the laptop on soft surfaces like beds or cushions where ventilation is restricted. Use a cooling pad or elevate the rear slightly to improve airflow. You should also regularly clean dust buildup near fan outlets using compressed air. If the heating is abnormal even during light usage, check your power settings and consider updating your BIOS and GPU drivers from the official manufacturer site.

For front-load washing machines that are not draining, the most frequent culprit is a blocked filter or kinked drain hose. Locate the bottom filter cap, open it, and remove lint, coins, or cloth debris. Some models also offer a manual drain mode that you can activate via the control panel. If the machine still doesn’t drain, it's best not to force it open — call the service technician to inspect the internal pump and drainage system.

Other common issues like remote controls not working can usually be solved by replacing batteries and cleaning the sensor area on the device. For refrigerators not cooling properly, ensure that the vents inside are not blocked by containers and that the door seals are intact. You can also reset the temperature to the default settings and give the unit a few hours to stabilize.

Most importantly, always refer to the user manual for brand-specific error codes and troubleshooting steps. Many brands have mobile apps where you can self-diagnose issues or raise a ticket without calling customer support. And remember, attempting DIY fixes on sealed or warranty-covered devices may void the manufacturer’s warranty — so when in doubt, always seek professional help.
